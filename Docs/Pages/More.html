<td width="15%"><img src="..\Images\look.png"></td>
<td width="35%">We display photos of listings, host profiles, and reviews to help you make informed decisions when considering a host's space. We've also created search filters so you can narrow your results by type of accommodation, price, and location. For example, if you’re looking to make friends and stay with a host, select Private Room or Shared Room. Or if you’re looking for an entire space to call your own, go ahead and select the Entire Place filter.</td>

<td width="35%"> The host has the option to either accept or decline the request, or ask you questions about your trip. When a host responds to your request, we send you an email to let you know. If they don't respond within 24 hours, your request simply expires. The Instant Book button immediately confirms your reservation and closes the host's calendar to other incoming requests. We send you a receipt by email with your trip's details, and your host may follow up with you, too. </td>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<h4>A Community Built on Sharing</h4>
<p>
The beginning of the company was in 2008 when two designers who had space to share hosted three travelers looking for a place to stay. Now, millions of hosts and travelers choose to create a free account so they can list their space and book unique accommodations anywhere in the world.</p>
